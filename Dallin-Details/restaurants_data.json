I ordered a double cheeseburger,  onion rings and a frosted orange.  My husband got the 2 chili dog deal with fries and a coke.  He liked the chili on his dogs very much.  It had a little spice to it.  The fries were very good as well.  My hamburger came with 2 patties in a squished down bun and one slice of cheese not even melted.  The patties were warm,  not hot and there was nothing on it at all.  The onion rings were so greasy I could only eat 3 before my stomach was upset.  The frozen orange was too thick to drink,  but once it thawed a bit it was tasty.  We also ordered a peach pie.  It had very little peach in it and the crust was tough and chewy. The young man who took out order was nice,  but not welcoming.  Got down to business. The building is very clean and plenty of seating.  They have metal toilets in the bathroom.  \ud83d\ude42  i can say i went,  but i don't think i have to go back.  .",

Regardless we went at like 4:30pm on a Friday and it wasn't that busy which was great because we saw line up posters inside. The hot dogs were pretty delicious albeit smaller than expected (which is probably why they sell them in twos). The frosted orange was pretty great - like a creamsicle in drink form. If you wait a bit for it to melt it's perfect to eat with a spoon.",

Our server recommended the southern special in which we could select 3 entrees, 3 sides and 3 deserts. We ended up getting fried chicken, meatloaf and Chicken & Dumplings for the entrees and for the sides: fried green tomatoes, broccoli casserole and grits. While all the items were good, it was the fried chicken that stood out the most. It was perfectly breaded, not too greasy and tasted amazing. Desert was also great with our choice  cobbler and pudding. We could definitely see why this place is really popular. A definitive recommendation for anyone visiting the ATL.",

Additionally, a souvenir shop is conveniently located on-site, offering a wide selection of iconic Hard Rock merchandise.\n\nWhile the food may fall short of expectations, it's worth mentioning that I opted to venture beyond the usual American fare. The salmon was surprisingly decent, though the accompanying potatoes left much to be desired.\n\nHowever, the nachos proved to be a major disappointment. Despite being listed as an appetizer, they were priced as an entree. The flavors were bland and the chips were old.\n\nThe drinks were equally mediocre, with nothing particularly noteworthy. If you're seeking exceptional cocktails or craft beer, you'd be better served elsewhere.\n\nIn conclusion, Hard Rock Cafe Atlanta Downtown fails to live up to its iconic status. While the interior and atmosphere are enjoyable, the food and beverages lack the quality that one would expect from such a well-known establishment.",

I would come here or the lounge several times a year. My daughter loves this place. But the lounge and restaurant were closed for an extended period. The restaurant is open and we returned.\n\nThe atmosphere is the same; classic, upscale and a great view. It no longer rotates, so we walked around the deck for a bit after dinner. The lounge is still closed.\n\nThe service and clientele has shifted a bit. Service is more personal and friendly. My server, Billy, was great. I can't think of a single thing that I'd change. He was there when I needed something. He was friendly and attentive to dietary restrictions, my kids needs and more.\n\nThey require that you buy an entree, which are about $70 each. This weeds out a lot of the more casual patrons that often came here in t-shirts and shorts after a nearby game for a drink while they rotated around the view.\n\nThe food is better than pre-pandemic. They have changed chefs. This food is more complex and refined. My duck had a great seasoning. The greens were also very good. My kid had chicken fingers and fries which were generous and she loved them.\n\nIt has rebranded itself from a tourist spectacle into a more refined upscale restaurant.",

But,  they state that right in the menu,  it make take a few minutes,  just relax,  and if that bothers you,  it probably isn't the place for you.  For us,  it was all good as we could just chat.\n\nThe food was pretty darn good.  Granted,  we only had burgers, but it was one of the better burgers either of us have had.  The staff was friendly,  and the food came out expeditiously.  I would recommend this bar and grill to anyone.  Just one point,  it is 21 and over,  so leave the young ones at home.",

Restaurant atmosphere is a lot of fun and well - awesome.  Was hopping to take in the full Vortex experience and sit in the main downstairs dining area but was told by staff tables are full (saw few empty tables). Which was a bummer but understandable.  We were sat quickly. Sat in upstairs patio area. Had a nice view of L5P.\n\nThe server took our order for food and drinks.  Apps came out fairly quick. Burgers took some time to come out. Server came to the table once and was not very attentive. Drinks were empty.    Went to downstairs bar to reorder drinks as our server was a no show. My burger and tots were cold and the others food was lukewarm. My fault - didn\u2019t say anything to the server. The burgers were fine - definitely not the best burger around.\n\nService and bar tender at downstairs bar was great!\n\nOverall disappointed. Waited all this time and ended up with cold food and service that was worse.\n\nFrom the reviews this sounds like a one off and most people have a great experience.",

I had never been, but some of my other family members had been a long time ago, so I really didn't know what to expect. We drove in the parking lot to park, and we found out that they had valet parking. It's was only 3 dollars to park, and they accepted all types of payments, so that was a plus.  When we finally got inside of the restaurant it was a very nice atmosphere... A couple of our group members were late, so we were able to sit at the bar, and the people were so nice. We finally got seated, and our waiter Patrick came over and introduced himself. He was very informative and just overall a pretty nice guy. All of the food and drinks were amazing. I got the red Snapper, and it was amazing. The only thing I can say was wrong is that one of my family members didn't get some of the items he had ordered when his food came out.

Even the butter that's served with is thought out and elegantly whipped to adorn the airy nature of the bread. Followed by a crab bisque soup which gets a layer of crab crowning the bowl that you wish you could just have to sustain life from that point forward. Then the fried chicken livers come and it makes you grateful the least expensive ingredients  can be the most amazing. The garnish, if you can call it that, that's served so thoughtfully alongside the lump crab cake, could be a dish unto itself.  The combination of the sprinkling of red pepper throughout the crab cake and the little kick from the spicy mayo is countered with the citrus, almost berry like pickle on the carrot slaw and baby green garnish. Then you arrive at the fried chicken entree and your life is complete. It's not so much served with a gravy as it is more similar to a sweet demiglaze that makes the mash and collards it is served with one cohesive delicious bite. I could not recommend a restaurant higher in any city I've been in. Many thanks to chef and the amazing staff represented by Eva at my table. Go, go, go and partake in this elevated southern cuisine.",

I will also mention that I did have a bad encounter with a waiter that did not service our table... The restaurant is very tight and my daughter and I were walking back to our patio seat from the inside bathroom. The tall waiter with long dreads turned and bumped into us and looked at my daughter and I and rolled his eyes and made a scoff sound even though I was apologetic and we weren't the ones in the wrong.

                "text": "At Max Lager's, I embarked on a culinary journey that ranged from sublime to disappointing. The shrimp dish that my wife ordered was a symphony of flavors which left an indelible mark on my taste buds. Succulent shrimp, delicately seasoned and perfectly cooked, danced on my palate with each bite. Accompanied by a tantalizing sauce that struck a harmonious balance between tangy and savory, this dish was an absolute triumph.\n\nNext, I delved into their steak selection, and I was met with sheer delight. The steak, cooked to perfection according to my specifications, boasted a charred exterior that gave way to tender, juicy meat with every forkful. Each bite was a testament to the chef's mastery of the grill, leaving me longing for more even after the last morsel was gone.\n\nHowever, the journey took a detour when I sampled the mashed potatoes. While they were passable, they lacked the creamy richness and depth of flavor that one would expect from a top-tier restaurant. Their mediocrity was a stark contrast to the culinary excellence exhibited elsewhere on the menu, leaving me underwhelmed and longing for more.\n\nThe disappointment continued with the undercooked green beans, which failed to reach the desired level of tenderness. Their raw crunchiness detracted from the overall dining experience, casting a shadow over the otherwise stellar meal.\n\nTo conclude the evening, we shared and indulged in a slice of red velvet cake, only to be met with disappointment once again. The cake, while visually appealing, was served cold, robbing it of the moist, decadent texture that defines a true red velvet masterpiece. It was a lackluster finale to an otherwise memorable meal.\n\nIn summary, Max Lager's showcased culinary prowess with its shrimp dish and steak, but faltered with its mashed potatoes, undercooked green beans, and cold red velvet cake. While the highs were undeniably high, the lows served as a reminder that even the finest establishments have room for improvement.\n\nI\u2019d love to come back to witness an improved experience.\n\nKing",

My recent visit was a testament to their dedication to quality and flavor.\n\nThe ribs, the star of the show, were seasoned and cooked to near perfection. Despite arriving later in the evening and finding them a tad dried out, the rich, smoky flavors still shone through, highlighting the skill and expertise behind the grill.\n\nComplementing the ribs was the jalapeno cornbread, a delightful blend of spice and sweetness that balanced the meal beautifully. Initially, I was skeptical about the macarons, thinking they might be dry based on their appearance, but I was pleasantly surprised by their moist, flavorful texture.\n\nThe greens, although meatless, were a standout with their well-crafted seasoning that offered a hearty, satisfying taste. Each bite was a reminder of the thoughtful preparation that goes into the sides at Fox Bros BBQ.\n\nThe ambiance at Fox Bros is equally inviting, with a welcoming series and staff that make you feel right at home. Special mention goes to my server, Patrick, whose attentive service added a personal touch to the experience.\n\nIn conclusion, Fox Bros BBQ is a must-visit for barbecue lovers in Atlanta. Despite a minor hiccup with the ribs, the overall quality of food and service ensures I will be back. I rate my experience a solid 4 out of 5 stars.",

The place was not busy at all. We were seated at a table where the furniture looked dated except the private booths.  The lighting was way too bright for business dinner restaurant.\n\nThe menu had some nice offerings and decided on the Parmesan Crusted Flounder which included Piccata Style Shrimp, Mashed Potatoes, and Asparagus. Our waitress was so so where did not really add to the experience dining here. When my food arrived I noticed two large pieces of fish. I was also surprised to see three huge shrimp on top of it. I rather just have the fish.  The asparagus looked awful and stayed away from it. The flounder tasted good where the crust needed a bit more flavor but did complement well with the mashed potatoes.\n\nOverall expected more from McCormick & Schmick's.",

The lobster bisque that I had tasted good, but when I was swishing it around, I could see layers of oil.

Also, I like that the servings are not so tiny that they leave you hungry.  If you\u2019re a first time visitor, the waitstaff does a great job with food recommendations from the menu.  Everything our waitress recommended was on point.  Pro-tip:  THIS IS A CASHLESS establishment, so bring your credit cards!\n\nThe ambience is cozy and intimate.  The dress code is smart casual.  There is valet parking on site, but there are plenty of street parking  available on Cypress and surrounding streets (just pay with ParkMobile app).\n\nNotable appetizers to try are honey goat cheese and pork belly.  The goat cheese and the honey are a great combination.  The pork belly is flavored to perfection.  I wish it comes in more than 2 small skewers on a small plate.  Other  notable side dishes are wood roasted shrimp and pan con tomate, both of which are delicious.\n\nNotable drinks I\u2019d recommend are the \u201cLong Live the Queen\u201d and \u201cPink Panther.\u201d  Both of which are good.\n\nThe restaurant ran out of its most popular entree, the papardelle, on the Saturday evening I visited.  But nevertheless, the Spaghetti al nero (squid ink noodles in a slightly spicy blue crab sauce) the waitress recommended tasted exquisite.  My companions tried the campanelle (white chicken ragu) and loved it, too!\n\nOverall, if you\u2019re looking to experience a Midtown restaurant with exquisite tasting foods, great ambience, and friendly service that\u2019s also big bang for your bucks, give Ecco a try.",

While valet parking is offered, my party decided to self park on the back side of the parking area. I had the Fried Chicken and while it was good, it wasn\u2019t anything amazing. My party decided to share 2 appetizers. The quesadilla didn\u2019t have much flavor but it was pretty filling. The spring rolls were cooked well but required the pepper jelly to carry the flavor. Someone else in my party ordered dishes that came with Mac and cheese and it was mushy. However, the collard greens were really tasty. The steak dishes were done pretty well but once again, the accompaniments like the onion rings needed work. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019d personally visit again because the meal was so lack luster. I think it could be a nice place to stop by for quick appetizers but I would definitely consider other options first.",

The gumbo that was recommended was lacking that gumbo flavored and just tasted salty. The garlic mashed potatoes and creamed spinach were luke warm. The first batch of menus they gave us were also wet from a spilled drink. It could be because we came an hour before closing, but that's a horrible excuse when you pay the prices they charge. Also half the mints at the front had their wrapper broken. Overall a mediocre experience and one I won't be trying out again.\n\nOh the cheesecake was good.",

The ambiance was pleasant, with a classy and comfortable setting, but it didn't stand out as particularly unique or memorable.\n\nThe menu featured a variety of steaks and side dishes. We ordered several sides to complement our meal:\n\n- **Lobster Mac and Cheese ($27):** I would rate this a 6. It was decent but didn't have the rich, indulgent flavor I expected.\n- **Mashed Potatoes ($14):** These were smooth and creamy, earning a rating of 7.\n- **Sweet Potato Casserole ($15):** This dish was quite good, with a nice balance of sweetness and texture. I'd give it an 8.\n- **Grilled Asparagus ($13):** Well-prepared but nothing extraordinary, so I rate it a 7.\n- **Stuffed Mushrooms ($19):** These were flavorful and enjoyable, deserving an 8.\n- **House Salad ($12):** Kind of small but had some nice flavors, earning an 8.\n\nFor the main course, I got the Cowboy Ribeye with shrimp. It was only seasoned with pepper and salt. I would have preferred a few more seasonings, such as garlic, onion, or maybe some seasoning salt. However, it was prepared perfectly.\n\nWe finished off with dessert and got the bread pudding with whiskey sauce, which was burned and didn't taste pleasant.\n\nOverall, for spending over $1,000 for six people, we could have gone somewhere else and had better food. While the food and service were acceptable, they did not live up to the high expectations set by the restaurant's reputation. It's a decent option, but there are other steakhouses that offer a more memorable experience.",

Generally it was a bit too wet and saucy for me, but it was high quality and prepared well. The atmosphere was really great and the service from Kyla was exceptional. I\u2019ll definitely go here again. The coffee was really good and everyone was very nice.",

The acting is fantastic and you see many of the same faces from play to play (or helping out with tickets / behind the bar / etc.!). Parking is easy and the building has great air conditioning. We love the atmosphere and appreciate how it was designed after the original Globe theatre, as well as the commitment to the original practice of the plays. Tickets are reasonably priced and easy to purchase on the website. Highly recommend!!\n\nPS - don\u2019t forget to check out the hilarious show-related memes printed on the back of the bathroom stall doors. \ud83d\ude0a",
